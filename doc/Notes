To run under the debuuger follow this procedure:

1. run ./IanOSd
2. In another terminal window run gdb
3. Type "continue" at the gdb prompt
4. Once the system has booted press <ctrl>-C
5. type "file IanOS.o" at the gdb prompt
6. Now set whatever breakpoints you want and type "continue"

Should Delete file check all FCBs to see if anyone has that file open?

stat system call is taking an FD parameter, but it should be a filename.

Big memory leak. In DoExec we allocate new memory for program but don't free existing pages!!!
