<<T Display>><<H1 Display>><<CONT>><<HR>>As with the keyboard, the display is handled by a kernel task (<<X consoleTaskCode>> in <<F console.c>>). This function is very straightforward. It accepts requests on the port <<C ConsolePort>>; currently it handles 3 types of request - write a character, write a string, and clear the screen. Characters are written directly to video memory - this is strictly a text-based display at the moment.<<PAR>><<HR>><<CONT>>
