<h3>Building</h3>
Untarring the file <<S IanOS.tar.gz>> will result in a directory <<S IanOS>> containing all of the source files required to build the system. Within this directory run the command:
<<PAR>>
<<D+ tasks/createdisk.sh>>
to create a hard disk image <<S c.hdd>>. Note that you will need to be root to run this command; if not logged on as root (you never do that do you!) you will need to use <<S su>> or <<S sudo>>. This hard disk image will be populated with some files by the Makefile in <<S tasks>>. To access this hard disk image we use <<S mtools>>. The file <<S /etc/mtools.conf>> should be edited so that it contains a line similar to:
<<PAR>>
<<D+ drive c: file="/home/ian/Projects/IanOS/c.hdd" offset=32256>>
(adjust the path to <<S IanOS>> to suit your system).
<<PAR>>
Now (still in directory <<S IanOS>>) run the command <<S make all>> to build the system.
The result will be a floppy disk image file <<S IanOS.fdd>> and a few files added to <<S c.hdd>>.
You can check that those files are there with the command:
<<PAR>>
<<D+ mdir c:>>
which should produce a listing that looks something like:
<<PAR>>
<<D TASK1    BIN       634 2008-03-22  20:56>>
<<D TASK2    BIN       262 2008-03-22  20:56>>
<<D+ TASK3    BIN       378 2008-03-22  20:56>>
(only the file names are important).
<<H3 Running>>
Run <<S simnow>>. At the main window choose the menu option <<S File/Open BSD>> and open the file <<S bsds/cheetah_1p.bsd>>. Then use the <<S File menu>> to set the primary IDE disk and floppy disk to those that we have just created. At this point you should save the BSD so that you don't have to repeat this step every time you want to run the system. I have found <<S simnow>> to be a little buggy when BSDs are opened and closed, so it's best to close <<S simnow>>, restart it, and load the BSD that you have just created. Click on the <<S run>> toolbar icon and the system will boot and run.
